Queue: abstract data type (FIFO)
	e.g. Services
	- Enqueue(key): adds key to collection
	- Key Dequeue(): removes and returns least recently-added key
	- Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?
	- O(1) runtime for above operations

Implementation with Linked List:
	- Doubly Linked List with head and tail
	- Enqueue: uses List.PushBack
	- Dequeue: uses List.TopFront and List.PopFront
	- Empty: uses List.Empty

Implementation with Array:
	- Two pointers: read and write
	- After we reach end of array, go back to the front of the array
