Tree:
	- empty
	- node with:
		- key
		- list of child trees
		- (optional) parent

Leaf: no children
Interior node: has children

Forest: collection of trees

Binary Tree:
	- node with:
		- key
		- left
		- right
		- (optional) parent

Depth-first: Completely traverse one sub-tree before exploring sibling sub-tree (stack)
	- InOrderTraversal(tree): finish one side before going back up for sorted order (BINARY TREE)
	- PreOrderTraversal(tree): finish top down order down a side before going back up
	- PostOrderTraversal(tree): starts from left side and finishes the lowest level child before going back up to parent
Breadth-first: Traverse all nodes at one level before progressing to the next level (queue)
	- LevelTraversal(tree): queue parent before queueing children of other parent
